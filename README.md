# Forwarder-Receiver Pattern Demo

This project is a simple demonstration of the Forwarder-Receiver pattern implemented in a To-Do List application. Every time a note is added, it is stored using a randomly selected method: Local Storage, an in-memory array, or a JSON object. The stored method is displayed alongside each note.

## Features

- Notes are randomly stored using different methods.

- Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## How It Works

2. A random storage method is chosen (Local Storage, Array, or JSON Object).
3. The note is stored in the chosen method.
4. The UI updates to show all notes and their storage locations.

## Usage
Simply open `index.html` in a browser and start adding notes.
